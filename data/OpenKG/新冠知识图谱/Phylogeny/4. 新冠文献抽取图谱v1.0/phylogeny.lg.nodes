554,7,Phylogenetic analysis of genomic sequences of coronaviruses deposited in the GenBank revealed that 2019-nCoV belonged to betacoronavirus and exhibited the closest linkage with two SARS-like coronavirus from bat (bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21) ( Fig 1a ).,null

582,7,Besides- compared with the two Bat SARS-like Coronaviruses- 2019-nCoVs have 4- ?130- ?220 nonsynonymous SNPs on the three core genes respectively- which shows the differences among 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV-like Coronaviruses.,null

584,7,On the 644th aminoacidic position in 2019-nCoV sequence there is a threonine residue while the Bat SARS-like virus has a serine residue- instead the SARS virus has an alanine residue The data reported above show that the new 2019-nCoV significantly clustered with a sequence from the Bat SARS-like Coronavirus isolated in 2015.,null
585,6,,null
586,6,,null
587,7,This supports that the 2019-nCoV S-protein encoded by its genome has processed human receptor-binding ability close to that of SARS-CoV- and thus this newly emerged virus is likely able to bind to ACE2 and then to drive human-to-human transmission.,null

589,7,These data indicate that the RBD in S protein of 2019-nCoV may bind to ACE2 with the similar affinity as SARS-CoV RBD does.,null

618,6,,null
619,7,Considering that the protein-protein docking has already sampled a large number of thermodynamically probable- low-energy  binding  conformations-  these  results  indicate  that  the  existence  of  an  ACE2-binding conformation for 2019-nCoV S-RBD with an energy value < -37.4 kcal¡¤mol-1 is very limited.,null
